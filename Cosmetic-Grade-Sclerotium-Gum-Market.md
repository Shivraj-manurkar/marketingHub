Sclerotium gum, a polysaccharide derived from fungi, offers excellent thickening and stabilizing properties, making it an attractive ingredient for formulators. With growing consumer awareness regarding skin care and wellness, the cosmetic industry has shifted focus to clean-label products, which in turn fuels the market for sclerotium gum. In 2024, the market size is projected to reach approximately <strong>$150 million</strong>.</p> <p>Forecasts indicate strong demand through 2032. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around <strong>8%</strong> during the forecasting period. By 2032, the market size is anticipated to reach approximately <strong>$300 million</strong>. This growth is being driven by the rising popularity of organic cosmetics and the increasing usage of sclerotium gum as a natural alternative to synthetic thickeners in emulsions and creams.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>Additionally, the evolving landscape of cosmetic formulations poses opportunities for sclerotium gum. As formulators delve into innovative product development that aligns with consumer trends toward sustainability and clean beauty, the demand for sclerotium gum is likely to rise. This surge is also complemented by the ingredient's multifunctionality, which encompasses not only thickening but also moisturizing and stabilizing properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including skin care, hair care, and make-up products.</p> <p>Industry stakeholders are paying close attention to raw material sourcing and sustainability practices to capitalize on these trends.
