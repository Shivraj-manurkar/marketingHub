The construction and landscaping industries also contribute significantly to the demand, utilizing sandbags for erosion control, retaining walls, and as a versatile building material. The forecasted market growth signals a robust future outlook for the sandbag sector. </p> <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p> <p> According to forecasts, the sandbag market is expected to grow substantially, with an estimated market size of <strong>$320 million</strong> in 2024.
